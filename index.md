## So, hello there.
My name is rovertdude, and I mostly work on a series that I am currently making of a small Pokemon series called Perfect Harmony.
Not really much to say about this, Perfect Harmony is released to the public at https://rovertdude.github.io/perfectharmony

# Random Projects
The main projects I have been working on are VickiEssentials, VickiFreedomMod, Core, and I am mostly working on Perfect Harmony.
I created the group called Total-Core and PugFreedom [discontinued].
