<p>Just to say, in this series, Pokemon are able to talk however not everyone can understand, it's marked in "--" and italics is thoughts.</p>

<p><em>My name is Lily. I will be a Pokemon Master. I don't generally try to brag about it, but I know it will happen one day. I don't have any Pokemon of my own, but I will in a few days. I don't know what to pick. Hopefully I can make a decision.</em></p>

<p>"And so, that concludes our tutorial on Pokemon typing." said the professor on the recording.</p>

<p>"Once again, I still cant decide..." said Lily.</p>

<p>"Oh come on now, I know you will eventually." said Lily's mother. "It doesn't depend on which is the strongest, but which fits you the best."</p>

<p>"They all fit me the best!" said Lily.</p>

<p>"You still have three days that you can think of which to pick." said Lily's mother. "I know you can decide during that time."</p>

<p>"I hope I can." said Lily as her mother left the room.</p>
